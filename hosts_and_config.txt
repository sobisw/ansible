Ansible Config

Default Ansible Config File: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

By default, ANSIBLE_CONFIG value will be taken. If not found it will look for ansible.cfg in current working directory then fall back to home directory and look for .ansible.cfg. If not found anywhere it will look at /etc/ansible location.

Anything in configuration file can be overwritten in playbook or environment variable.

Need to focus on these parameters

Inventory  =  /etc/ansible/hosts
sudo_user  =   root
ask_sudo_pass  =  true
roles_path  =  /etc/ansible/roles
host_key_checking  =  False
log_path  =  /var/log/ansible.log

* Prefer disable SELinux to resolve any connectivity issue

HOSTS File

Default Host file: /etc/ansible/hosts

[local]
localhost
127.0.0.1

[apacheweb]
1.2.3.4
web.domain.com
web

We can update ansible.cfg file , inventory parameter to any file. Also we can use “-i" option to overwrite default hosts file e.g.  

ansible apacheweb -i hosts -m ping

To view all hosts - 


ansible all --list-hosts
